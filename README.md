Welcome to World Travel!
==============================

There are three models in this app: Visit, Traveler, and Country.
Each traveler and country has many visits.
Each traveler has many countries through visits.
Each country has many travelers through visits.
Each visit belongs to a traveler and a country.

Before you can create a visit, you first need to make at least one country and at least traveler. Then you can select the appropriate country and traveler from a drop-down menu when you're creating a visit.
